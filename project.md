# Course project

All students in the class will write a "mini-paper" as a final project, which can be empirical, theoretical, or both. Students should write up the results in the [NeurIPS conference format](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).

## Working in groups
- Students are welcome to work in groups on the final project.
- Groups should include at most three students (except with special permission).
- I will expect a group of two students to put twice as much work into the final project than for a sole-author project, and similarly for groups of three.
- Students in groups are required to include a “contributions” paragraph in their paper that concretely lists each author's contributions.
- The paper length for a final project write-up is 3 + n where n is the number of people in the group that worked on the project, not including references or the contributions paragraph.

## Milestones
- **October 10**: Add information about topics you find interesting to a project matching spreadsheet.
- **October 31**: Each group will submit a short progress report of 1-2 pages. Describe your project and partial progress.
- **December 4**: Students will present their final project during class.
- **December 12**: Each group will submit their final report.

## Grading
- **Project matching spreadsheet**: 3 points.
- **Progress report**: 7 points.
- **Writing**: 10 points; your final paper should be readable and complete, and it should clearly contextualize your results within prior research.
- **Novelty**: 10 points; your project should propose something new (either a new application, method, or perspective).
- **Final presentation**: 10 points; your final project presentation should be clear and provide a solid picture of what you did.
