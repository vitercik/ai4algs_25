# Discussion class format

- There will be twelve **discussion classes** centered on important papers in the field. Each class will begin with a short presentation by the instructor and then move into discussion.
- Discussions use rotating student roles, adapted from a [course design](https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html) by Alec Jacobson and Colin Raffel.
- Students present **in small groups** (typically 2–3 students sharing a role on a given day). **Groups must coordinate** to create a coherent mini-talk.
- Each student will serve in a **presenter role for four of the twelve classes**, contributing an **approximately 10-minute segment** (followed by ~2 minutes of Q&A for the group).
- For the **remaining eight classes**, each student completes the **non-presenting assignment** before class.

## Presenter roles
- **Archaeologist:** Explain where the paper sits in the literature. Find and report on one older paper cited by the current paper and one newer paper citing the current paper.
- **Researcher:** Propose a plausible follow-up project that is possible specifically because of this paper’s ideas, results, data, code, or benchmarks. Your presentation should include answers (implicitly or explicitly) to the following simplified version of the [Heilmeier Catechism](https://stanfordh4d.substack.com/p/technology-transfer-for-defense-leveraging):
  - What are we trying to do?
  - How is it done today, and what are the limitations?
  - What’s new in our idea, and why might it succeed?
  - If successful, what difference will it make?
  - What’s the first thing we can try to test the idea?

- **NeurIPS Reviewer:** Provide a balanced, evidence-based review with at least three strengths and at least three weaknesses. Touch on the following dimensions from the [NeurIPS reviewer guidelines](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2025/ReviewerGuidelines):
  - **Quality:** Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported (e.g., by theoretical analysis or experimental results)? Are the methods appropriate? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about strengths and weaknesses?
  - **Clarity:** Is the submission clearly written and well organized? Does it adequately inform the reader (enough detail for reproduction)?
  - **Significance:** Are the results impactful? Will others build on the ideas? Does it address a difficult task better than prior work or advance understanding in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, conclusions, or approaches?
  - **Originality:** Is it clear how this work differs from prior contributions, with relevant citations? Does it introduce novel tasks or methods, or a well-reasoned novel combination of techniques? (Novel insights or improved efficiency/fairness can also count as originality.)

## Non-presenter assignment
By **1pm on the day of the discussion**, post at least one question about the paper to Ed Discussion. Your question can be something you found confusing or a topic you’d like the class to explore.

## Grading
- **Presenter contributions:** 4 presentations × **9** points each = **36 points**.
- **Non-presenter assignments:** 8 submissions × **3** points each = **24 points**.
- **Total:** **60 points**.
