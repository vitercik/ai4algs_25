# Discussion class format

- There will be twelve **discussion classes** which will center around important papers in the field. These classes will begin with a presentation by the instructor about the paper and will be followed by a discussion.
- The discussions will be organized around different “roles” that students will play. (This format is based on a course design by [Alec Jacobson and Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html).)
- Each student will take on one of the following **presenter roles** for six of the twelve discussion classes and give an approximately 7-minute presentation followed by 3 minutes of questions and discussion.
- For the remaining six discussion classes, the student will come to class having completed the **non-presenting assignment**.

## Presenter roles
- **Archaeologist:** Determine where this paper sits in the context of previous and subsequent work. Find and report on one older paper cited by the current paper and one newer paper citing this current paper.
- **Researcher:** Propose an imaginary followup project not just based on the current but only possible due to the existence and success of the current paper.
- **NeurIPS Reviewer:** Complete review of the paper (critical but not necessarily negative). Answer the questions on the [NeurIPS Review Form](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/ReviewerGuidelines).

## Non-presenter assignment
By 1pm on the day of the discussion, post at least one question about the paper to Ed Discussion (either something you're confused about or something you'd like to hear discussed more).

## Grading
- Each presentation is worth 8 points, for a total of 48 points.
- Each non-presenter assignment is worth 2 points, for a total of 12 points.
