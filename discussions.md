# Discussion class format

- There will be twelve **discussion classes** which will center around important papers in the field. These classes will begin with a presentation by the instructor about the paper and will be followed by a discussion.
- Discussions are organized around rotating student roles, adapted from a [course design](https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html) by Alec Jacobson and Colin Raffel.
- Each student will take on one of the following **presenter roles** for six of the twelve discussion classes and give an approximately 7-minute presentation followed by 3 minutes of questions and discussion.
- For the remaining six discussion classes, the student will come to class having completed the **non-presenting assignment**.

## Presenter roles
- **Archaeologist:** Explain where the paper sits in the literature. Find and report on one older paper cited by the current paper and one newer paper citing this current paper.
- **Researcher:** Propose a plausible follow-up project that is possible specifically because of this paperâ€™s ideas, results, data, code, or benchmarks.
- **NeurIPS Reviewer:** Provide a balanced, evidence-based review with at least three strengths and at least three weaknesses. Touch on the following dimensions from the [NeurIPS reviewer guidelines](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2025/ReviewerGuidelines):
  - Quality: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported (e.g., by theoretical analysis or experimental results)? Are the methods used appropriate? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?
  - Clarity: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note that a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)
  - Significance: Are the results impactful for the community? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance our understanding/knowledge on the topic in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?
  - Originality: Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions, with relevant citations provided? Does the work introduce novel tasks or methods that advance the field? Does this work offer a novel combination of existing techniques, and is the reasoning behind this combination well-articulated? As the questions above indicates, originality does not necessarily require introducing an entirely new method. Rather, a work that provides novel insights by evaluating existing methods, or demonstrates improved efficiency, fairness, etc. is also equally valuable.

## Non-presenter assignment
By 1pm on the day of the discussion, post at least one question about the paper to Ed Discussion. Your question can be something you found confusing or a topic you would like the class to explore.

## Grading
- Each presentation is worth 8 points, for a total of 48 points.
- Each non-presenter assignment is worth 2 points, for a total of 12 points.
